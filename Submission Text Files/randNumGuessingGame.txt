# A program that generates a random number in the range of 1 through 100
# and asks the user to guess what the number is. Count the number of guesses.
# Once the user has guessed the number, congratulate the user and ask if 
# they want to continue. If yes, generate a new random number and start over.
# If no, exit the program.
