# The Springfork Amateur Golf Club has a tournament every weekend.
# The club president has asked you to write two programs:
# 1. A program that will read each player’s name and golf score as
# keyboard input, and then save these as records in a file named golf.txt.
# (Each record will have a field for the player’s name
# and a field for the player’s score.)
# 2. A program that reads the records from the golf.txt file and displays them.

# A fucntion to get the player's name from the user
def playerName():
    nameInput = input('Enter player\'s name: ')
    # Return the player's name to main
    return nameInput

def main():
    # Create golf.txt in write
    golfRecord = open('golf.txt','w')
    # Define loop condition for multiple inputs
    nameLoop = 'y'
    while nameLoop == 'y' or nameLoop == 'Y':
        # Assign variable to the output of playerName function
        nameInput = playerName()
        # Write the player name to golf.txt
        golfRecord.write(str(nameInput) + '\n')
        # Ask for score from user and assign the input to var score
        score = int(input('Enter score for ' + nameInput + ': '))
        # Write score into golf.txt
        golfRecord.write(str(score) + '\n')
        #Ask if user would like to add more entries
        nameLoop = input('Would you like to enter another player? Y/n ' )

    # Close the file and print a goodbye message
    golfRecord.close()
    print('Scores have been recorded in the ledger.')
